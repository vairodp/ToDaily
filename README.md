# ToDaily
_The project created for Android devices using the Java language and the environment of
Android Studio development, aims to be a support for the user who wants to organize
their daily activities. The activity lists can be divided in turn into
categories to facilitate the organization and management of the same by the user. Every
activities can be assigned a different degree of priority from 0 (not very urgent) to 2
(urgent). There is also the possibility to insert reminders, which will activate
notifications which in turn can be customized according to the degree of priority chosen.
If it is hypothetically chosen to activate notifications only for medium-high activity
priority, the user will then receive the reminder only for that type of job._
